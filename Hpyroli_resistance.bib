              Helicobacter pylori
              is a gram-negative pathogen that colonizes the stomachs of over half the world's population and causes a spectrum of gastric diseases including gastritis, ulcers, and gastric carcinoma. The
              H. pylori
              species exhibits unusually high levels of genetic variation between strains. Here we announce the complete genome sequence of
              H. pylori
              strain G27, which has been used extensively in
              H. pylori

	abstract = {Helicobacter pylori was classiﬁed by the World Health Organization as a class 1 carcinogen. The development of drug-resistant strains of this pathogen poses a serious threat to human health worldwide. The cell invasion of H. pylori activates xenophagy in gastric epithelial cells by mediating miR-30b/c, and the emergence of autophagosomes provides a niche that enables the survival of intracellular H. pylori and promotes its drug resistance. This study revealed that some clinical drug-resistant H. pylori strains present much stronger invasive ability than standard strains. Patchouli alcohol (PA), a tricyclic sesquiterpene from Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth (Labiatae), showed reliable activity against intracellular H. pylori. The mechanisms appeared to involve the downregulation of miR-30c-3p/5p and miR-30b-5p, thereby upregulating xenophagyrelated gene expression (ULK1, ATG5, ATG12, and ATG14) and enhancing xenophagy. PA also inhibited the nuclear transfection of miR-30b-5p induced by H. pylori, thereby enhancing transcription factor EB function and increasing lysosome activity. The ﬁnding of strongly invasive intracellular H. pylori has great implications for clinical treatment, and PA can act against invasive H. pylori based on the improvement of miR-30b/c mediated xenophagy. Taken together, the results demonstrate that PA have potential use as a candidate medication for intracellular drug-resistant H. pylori.},

	abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen. Diagnosis of H. pylori infection and determination of its antibiotic susceptibility still mainly rely on culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) that is time-consuming and laborious. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has recently emerged in medical microbiology as a diagnostic tool for reliable drug resistance prediction in bacterial pathogens. The aim of this study was to compare phenotypic DST results with the predictions based on the presence of genetic determinants identified in the H. pylori genome using WGS. Phenotypic resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, levofloxacin, and rifampicin was determined in 140 clinical H. pylori isolates by E-Test®, and the occurrence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in target genes was determined by WGS. Overall, there was a high congruence of {\textgreater}99\% between phenotypic DST results for clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and rifampicin and SNPs identified in the 23S rRNA, gyrA, and rpoB gene. However, it was not possible to infer a resistance phenotype for metronidazole based on the occurrence of distinct SNPs in frxA and rdxA. All 140 H. pylori isolates analysed in this study were susceptible to tetracycline, which was in accordance with the absence of double or triple nucleotide substitutions in the 16S rRNA gene.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the primary resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to routinely used antibiotics in Cambodia, an unexplored topic in the country, and assessed next-generation sequencing’s (NGS) potential to discover genetic resistance determinants. Fifty-ﬁve H. pylori strains were successfully cultured and screened for antibiotic susceptibility using agar dilution. Genotypic analysis was performed using NGS data with a CLC genomic workbench. PlasmidSeeker was used to detect plasmids. The correlation between resistant genotypes and phenotypes was evaluated statistically. Resistances to metronidazole (MTZ), levoﬂoxacin (LVX), clarithromycin (CLR), and amoxicillin (AMX) were 96.4\%, 67.3\%, 25.5\%, and 9.1\%, respectively. No resistance to tetracycline (TET) was observed. Multi-drug resistance aﬀected 76.4\% of strains. No plasmids were found, but genetic determinants of resistance to CLR, LVX, and AMX were 23S rRNA (A2146G and A2147G), GyrA (N87K and D91Y/N/G), and pbp1 (P473L), respectively. No determinants were genetically linked to MTZ or TET resistance. There was high concordance between resistant genotypes and phenotypes for AMX, LVX, and CLR. We observed high antibiotic resistance rates of CLR, MTZ, and LVX, emphasizing the need for periodic evaluation and alternative therapies in Cambodia. NGS showed high capability for detecting genetic resistance determinants and potential for implementation in local treatment policies.},

	abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen for which increasing antibiotic resistance constitutes a serious threat to human health. Molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance have been intensively studied and are discussed in this Review. Three profiles of resistance —single drug resistance, multidrug resistance and heteroresistance — seem to occur, probably with overlapping fundamental mechanisms and clinical implications. The mechanisms that have been most studied are related to mutational changes encoded chromosomally and disrupt the cellular activity of antibiotics through target-mediated mechanisms. Other biological attributes driving drug resistance in H. pylori have been less explored and this could imply more complex physiological changes (such as impaired regulation of drug uptake and/or efflux, or biofilm and coccoid formation) that remain largely elusive. Resistance-related attributes deployed by the pathogen cause treatment failures, diagnostic difficulties and ambiguity in clinical interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. Subsequent to the increasing antibiotic resistance, a substantial drop in H. pylori treatment efficacy has been noted globally. In the absence of an efficient vaccine, enhanced efforts are needed for setting new treatment strategies and for a better understanding of the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, as well as for improving diagnostic tools that can help optimize current antimicrobial regimens.},
